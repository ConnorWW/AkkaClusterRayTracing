  # partition are created in surviving partition. The purpose of this margin is that
  # in case of a network partition the persistent actors in the non-surviving partitions
  # must be stopped before corresponding persistent actors are started somewhere else.
  # This is useful if you implement downing strategies that handle network partitions,
  # e.g. by keeping the larger side of the partition and shutting down the smaller side.
  # Decision is taken by the strategy when there has been no membership or
  # reachability changes for this duration, i.e. the cluster state is stable.

  # and it could result in delayed or conflicting decisions on separate sides of a network
  # partition.
  # As a precaution for that scenario all nodes are downed if no decision is made within
  # `stable-after + down-all-when-unstable` from the first unreachability event.

# that the cluster must have to be operational. If there are unreachable nodes when starting
# up the cluster, before reaching this limit, the cluster may shutdown itself immediately.
# This is not an issue if you start all nodes at approximately the same time.
